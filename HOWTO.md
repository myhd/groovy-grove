#### General tips

- These tips are written for Mac users. Your computing platform may be different.
- It may be that you need a low-capacity SD card for the MP3 player. 8 GB appear to work well.
- Use [SD Memory Card Formatter](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/index.html) to format the SD card. Format it in FAT32 format.



#### Putting files on the SD card

- For the examples used in this project, copy your MP3s into the `MP3` folder on the SD card. Name them 0001.mp3, 0002.mp3, etc.
- At one point, eject the SD card and put it into the player



#### Setting up the hardware

- Troubleshooting Computer-Arduino connections: Make sure the USB cable you use is OK. Some cables only provide power, *not* a data connection. If your Arduino does not appear in the Arduino IDE for uploading, make sure you use a good cable. To troubleshoot, test the connection with another cable. Also, some cables turn bad without any good reason.

- Make sure you have the right drivers: If using a Seeed Lotus 1.1 board, it may be necessary install drivers for the Seeeduino with Mac OS: https://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP/MacOSX/FTDIUSBSerialDriver_v2_4_2.dmg (as of June 2020)
